    <h4>6. Purpose of Past Perfect Continuous Tense</h4>
    <p>
        The challenging form of the past perfect continuous is as follows. There are a lot of websites that will state that they can describe this tense in just a short article, but unfortunately, this is not feasible (sorry!). This particular version of the word is used in a few distinct contexts, and depending on those contexts, it can convey a variety of different meanings. Here are some examples:
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s important to keep in mind that these correspond fairly closely with the various ways in which we use the present perfect continuous form:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recent Efforts That Have Been Realized</li>
        <li>Actions That Are Still Being Taken (with <i>for</i> and <i>since</i>)</li>
        <li>Different Patterns of Conduct and Habits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I had been traveling since five o’clock in the morning, which is an example of the past perfect continuous tense. The only difference is that the time reference is in the past.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>She had been touring India for three weeks.</li>
        <li>She had been learning Hindi for five months.</li>
        <li>Alex Meraj had been playing for the opposite team for two months.</li>
    </ul>
